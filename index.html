<b>WCAT in Ireland</b>
</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><IMG SRC="wcat.jpg" alt=wcat width=400 height=100></div>
<p> In Sepetember of 2016 I had the amazing opportunity of traveling to Dublin, Ireland in order to cover three highschool football games as well as the Boston College versus Georgia Tech season opener. 
Over the course of four days I spent time interviewing college atheltes and coachs as well as live broadcasting three highschool football games from teams all across America competeing in the Ireland 
Football Showcase. After calling three live broadcast I had the opportunity to test my skills on a professional level by covering the GT vs. BC game from the sidelines as well as post-game interviews 
and press conferences.</p>

<p>While I am not a fan of either Georgia Tech or Boston College the expeirence was still once in a life time and the sideline passes didn't hurt! While on the field I got to watch some incredibe football
with the Jackets just beating Boston College in a thriller game. Even though I wasn't cheering for a particular game taking in the sights and sounds of being on the field, in Ireland for College football
is an experience I'll never forget.</p>
